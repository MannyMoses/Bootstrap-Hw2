Portfolio

In this project, we were tasked with making a responsive portfolio website that will be the beginning of our dive into the world of web development and the main eye candy for companies interested in our talents. The project needed to have three pages (about me, portfolio, contact info), and be a reflection of our personal tastes and styles as well as allowing us to flex our coding chops.
